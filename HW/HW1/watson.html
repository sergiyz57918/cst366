  <div><p><i>The computer's techniques for unravelling Jeopardy! clues sounded just like mine. That machine zeroes in on keywords in a clue then combs its memory (in Watson's case, a 15-terabyte databank of human knowledge) for clusters of associations with those words. It rigorously checks the top hits against all the contextual information it can muster: the category name; the kind of answer being sought; the time, place, and gender hinted at in the clue; and so on. And when it feels "sure" enough, it decides to buzz. This is all an instant, intuitive process for a human Jeopardy! player, but I felt convinced that under the hood my brain was doing more or less the same thing. </i></p><p>â€” Ken Jennings</p></div>
  <p>In the past, we had a computer competing against humans in a variety of games, chess will be a good example. Although nothing amazed and terrified people as much as when IBM Watson project start beating champions of the popular TV game show Jeopardy.</p>
  <p>Watson was faster and more confident than human players. It might have seemed that he had all the answers. Which was true, as Watson was connected to an enormous library of encyclopedic knowledge, and was performing a context search. Something that we enjoy now by using search engines.  </p>
