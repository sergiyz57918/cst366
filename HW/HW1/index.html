  <p>By the show of hands, how many of you watched 2001: A Space Odyssey? If you never watched it, you should go and watch it before continuing to read. Although the movie is about space, and the Odessey, and aliens, and the future of humanity. We honestly do not care about any of that.</p>
  <p>What we care about is competition between humans and machines. Who, said terminators? Get out of here. So come back when you find the source code for the SkyNet. We are not interested in purely physical or computational advantage machines could have over humans. Let's admit terminator was pretty dumb. However, what about arias in which we never thought that people could be defeated?</p>
  <p>It was hard to imagine that computer can beat someone in the game of Jeopardy, where you have to come up with the correct answer based on quite a vague question and a category. It was impossible to imagine computer taking on a world champion in the game of Go, one of the most challenging strategic board games humanity ever created. Moreover, no professional gamer could admit to himself that the computer destroyed him in Dota 2, the most complex tactical video game.</p>
  <p>That what this blog is about, strugle for the machine to overcome humans.</p>
